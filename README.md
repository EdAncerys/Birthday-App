# Post-Challenge 2: Birthday App

Challenge is to build a web app that will ask the user for a name and birthday.

When the user submits the form, and depending on the current date, the app will either:

wish the user happy birthday
tell them how long they'll have to wait until their next birthday

## How it works
- Main page have submit form that takes in name, day and month you are born in.
- Once submitted it redirect to a new page/view where you able to see days and month left till you birthday. And if it is you birthday - it is wishes you a happy birthday!

## How to run the app
- Fork the repository and clone it to your local.
- Bundle install all gems. 
- You need to run it localy on you server (by running comand rackup in terminal). 
- Have fun !
